# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cobb Douglas Production function** and is about the relationship between elasticities in the function taken capital and labour into account.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
