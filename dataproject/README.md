# Data analysis project

Our project is titled *Denmark's trading balance from 2009-2019* and is about analyzing Denmark's trade dynamics and economic performance during this specific time period. Through the analysis of import, export, net export, and potentially Gross Domestic Product (GDP) trends, we aim to gain insights into Denmark's trade balance and economic strength. 
Additionally, the calculation of the net export, which represents the difference between exports and imports, will allow us to evaluate the overall trade surplus or deficit of Denmark. Understanding the factors driving the net export can provide insights into the country's economic resilience and its ability to generate revenue from international trade.

The *results* of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the *following datasets*:

1. NAN1 (Danmarks Statistik) 

*Dependencies:* Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
