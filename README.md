This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from Danmark Statistik on NAN1 and show the export and import mechanisms in Danish economics.
3. Model project. We model a Cobb Douglas Production function using different parameter values and investigating different return to scale.
4. Exam project. This only includes one Jupyter notebook, which is all that the exam project requires.
